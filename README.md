# I make things sometimes.

### I haven't quite figured out how to make this page better yet, so you can just have a list of things I have helped with or done instead:

* [OpenKH](https://github.com/OpenKH/OpenKh)
	* A platform suite of community, documentation, and tooling centered around the video game series Kingdom Hearts to enable players to enjoy some of their favorite Disney/Square-Enix games their way.
* [Quadratum Command Menu - A Kingdom Hearts II (PC) Mod](https://github.com/Vladabdf/kh2QuadratumCM)
	* Also available, a [UHD version of the mod](https://github.com/Vladabdf/kh2QuadratumCM-UHD)
* [Dead Rising 2 Mod - Gameplay Plus](https://github.com/Vladabdf/DeadRising2GameplayPlus)
	* Includes various tweaks to Dead Rising 2 on PC, including:
		* Disabled excessive post-fx settings
		* Adding magazine effects to combo weapons

That's all for now

# KTHXBYE

##### P.S.

##### I love my girlfriend, and she's always in my heart. Idk if she'll find this, but if she does, 

##### <3 you.
